# node-red-brewery
Concept and code-snippets for brewery-automation with node-red

The automation-project will heavily rely on the concept of finite-state-machines (FSM) and hierachical-state-machines (HSM).
A good article with introducionary knwledge can be found here:
https://www.automation.com/library/articles-white-papers/process-control-process-monitoring/hierarchical-state-machines-in-the-automation-process

In Node-Red, the Module "node-red-contrib-state-machine" in Version 1.2.0 will be utilized.

It is a mixture of learning and product-development for me, feel free to add to the project if you want to!
Cheers
